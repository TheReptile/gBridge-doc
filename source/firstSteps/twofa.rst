Security confirmation
=======================

gBridge allows you to enable security confirmations for certain devices to prevent interacting with them unauthorized or accidentally. You can enable it in the device settings.

You can choose inbetween No confirmation, Acknowledgements and PIN code protection.

No confirmation
------------------

When asking Google to interact with a device, it is simply done without any further queries.

**Example**:

| **Hey Google, turn on {device name}**
| *OK, turning on {device name}*


Acknowledgement
----------------

Google queries back whether your want to execute the action.

**Example**:

| **Hey Google, turn on {device name}**
| *Are you sure you want to turn on {device name}?*
| **Yes.**
| *OK, turning on {device name}*


PIN code
-----------------

Google queries require you to say a PIN code to execute successfully. You can set a PIN code (consisting of numbers only) in the device settings.

**Example**:

| **Hey Google, turn on {device name}**
| *Can I have your security code to turn {device name} on?*
| **1234**
| *OK, turning {device name} on*
