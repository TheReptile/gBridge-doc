Support Guidelines
===================

We want to help every user of gBridge in the best possible manner. In order to keep this process efficient and quick, please follow the guidelines below.

Support Channels
---------------------
*   Please only open **Github issues** in one of our Github repositories, if you think you've discovered a problem or a bug with a gBridge component. Use the matching repository for opening your issue:
    
    - `gBridge <https://github.com/kservices/gBridge>`_ for problems with the gBridge software itself
    - `gBridge-docker <https://github.com/kservices/gBridge-docker>`_ for problems with gBridge docker images
    - `gBridge-docker-arm32v6 <https://github.com/kservices/gBridge-docker-arm32v6>`_ for problems with gBridge docker images for the ARM32V6 platform
    - `gBridge-doc <https://github.com/kservices/gBridge-doc>`_ for problems with the documentation

* Use our `community forum (community.gbridge.io) <https://community.gbridge.io>`_ for all sorts of questions about gBridge integration, feature requests and all other topics.
* Contact the **support team** under `gbridge@kappelt.net <mailto:gbridge@kappelt.net>`_ (or with the online contact forms) if you have any personal questions (e.g. about a problem with your account, questions about billing, etc.). Subscribers of the gBridge standard plan will be prioritized there (please provide your mail address or user id in the message then). Note that we'll be most likely unable to answer questions about the integration of gBridge with your smarthome software, though we do our best.
      
.. tip::
        From now on, you can contact our support team with Telegram, too: `@gBridgeSupportBot <https://telegram.me/gBridgeSupportBot>`_

Self Hosted gBridge
---------------------

Unfortunately, we can't and won't give any support for the self hosted version of gBridge, due to a high amount of inquiries.
