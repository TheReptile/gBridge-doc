*   Vance: http://va.nce.me/Google_Home_light_control_via_mqtt.html
    
    Vance describes his experiences while integrating gBridge in his setup.
    Please note the part about "Topic translation" is not necessary anymore, since custom MQTT topics were implemented into gBridge.

.. NOTE::
    It would be great if you could send me a short mail (to gbridge(at)kappelt.net) if you've found useful online resource referencing gBridge.

    These could be integrated into the documentation or be noted on this page, in order to help other users getting started.
