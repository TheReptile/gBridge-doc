Legacy User API
================

An undocumented API has been in development, but this process was stopped in favor of the current and more extensive "gBridge.io Management API". 

A preliminary version (that isn't yet fully tested and doesn't cover all features) is available, but not yet documented. It is currently only used by the `Domoticz gBridge Plugin <https://github.com/giejay/domoticz-gbridge-plugin>`_.
