gBridge.io Management API
===========================

A fully featured API for your account is available. You can create individual API keys in your account's dashboard under "My Account".

There is an extensive API endpoint documentation available: `https://doc.gbridge.io/apidoc <https://doc.gbridge.io/apidoc>`_

Please mind that the examples of this documentation aren't fully up-to-date and propably won't work "out of the box". However, the object and endpoint documentation covers all endpoints and objects.
